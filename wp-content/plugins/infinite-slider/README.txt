Innovative slider plugin for WordPress based sites. Features 20 or more tiles of your best content on the same page! Draggable and responsive.

== Description ==

Web users are starting to get bored by the currently prevailing trend of one huge image at the top of the website usually followed by a couple of more slides *if* the user waits enough! They usually don't...

That's where Infinite Slider comes in: it brings the best content of your site to the surface via beautiful Featured Images that you (usually) have added to all your posts anyways! By featuring at least 20 (or more!) tiles on your page with images, description and a read more button in the focus area you'll surely get more interaction that with any other "regular" slider plugins out there. It's a truly innovative and unique idea that's now available to all WordPress owners for free! No "pro" versions, no paid support; just like in the old days of WP.org plugins! :) Enjoy.
